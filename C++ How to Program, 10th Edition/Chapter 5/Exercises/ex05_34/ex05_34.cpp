Note:  
My answer to exercise 5.34 using only the tools and methods taught up to Chapter 5.

This exercise is from the global Edition of C++ How to Program, 10/e 

Description:
	
     5.34 (Account Class That Stores a DollarAmount) Upgrade the Account class from Exercise 3.9 to 
define its balance data member as an object of class DollarAmount from Exercise 5.33. Reimplement 
the bodies of class Accountâ€™s constructor and member functions accordingly.

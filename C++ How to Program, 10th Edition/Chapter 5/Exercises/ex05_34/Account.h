Note: My answer to exercise 5.34 using only the tools and methods taught up to Chapter 5.

Description:

	5.34 (Account Class That Stores a DollarAmount) Upgrade the Account class from Exercise 3.9 to 
define its balance data member as an object of class DollarAmount from Exercise 5.33. Reimplement 
the bodies of class Accountâ€™s constructor and member functions accordingly.

***************************************************************************************************/

class Account{// class definition

private:
/******************           Data Members           ***********************/
std::string name; // account name data member
int balance{0}; // data member with default initial value

public:
/*********                     Member Functions                         ***********/

/*************************     Class Constructor    *******************************/ 
// initializes the data members
// Account constructor with two parameters
		Account(std::string accountName, int initialBalance)
			:name(accountName){// assign accountName to data member name
			
			// validate that the initialBalance is greater than 0; if not,
			// data member balance keeps its default initial value of 0
			if(initialBalance > 0){ // if the initialBalance valid
				balance = initialBalance; // assign it to data member balance 
			}//end if
		}// end Account constructor

/*************************   Set Member Functions   *******************************/
// Member Functions to set the data members
// function that sets the name
		void setName(std::string accountName){
			name = accountName;
		}// end setName 
	
/*************************   Get Member Functions   *******************************/
// Member functions to get data members value

// function returns account balance
		int getBalance() const{
			return balance;
		}//end getBalance

// function that returns the name
		std::string getName() const{
			return name;
		}// end getName	

/**************************  Other Member Functions *******************************/
// function that deposits (adds) only valid amount to the balance
		void deposit(int depositAmount){
			if(depositAmount > 0){ //if the depositAmount is valid
				balance = balance + depositAmount;// add it to the balance
			}//end if
		}// end deposit
		
//Exercise 3.9
//function to withdraw money from the Account
		void withdraw(int withdrawAmount){
			if(withdrawAmount <= balance){//if the withdrawAmount is valid
				balance = balance - withdrawAmount;// subtract it from balance
			}//end if
			else //if withdrawAmount isn't valid
				std::cerr << "Withdraw amount exceeded account balance";
		}// end withdraw
};// end ClassName class

Note: 
My answer to exercise 5.27 using only the tools and methods taught up to Chapter 5.

This exercise is from the global Edition of C++ How to Program, 10/e 

The 'continue' statement in this code can be remove by making use of the if...else statements.

Description:
	5.27 (Replacing continue with a Structured Equivalent) Describe in general how youâ€™d remove
any continue statement from a loop in a program and replace it with some structured equivalent. 

Use the technique you develop here to remove the continue statement from the program in Fig. 5.14.

----------- Output --------------------------------------------------------------------
1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 10 
Didn't used continue to skip printing 5

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   
-----------------------------      Fig. 5.14 Code      ------------------------------------
// Fig. 5.14: ContinueTest.cpp
// continue statement terminating an iteration of a for statement.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   for (unsigned int count{1}; count <= 10; count++) { // loop 10 times
      if (count == 5) {
         continue; // skip remaining code in loop body if count is 5
      }

      cout << count << " ";
   } 

   cout << "\nUsed continue to skip printing 5" << endl;
}

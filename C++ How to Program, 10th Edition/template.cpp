/*
Standard Library
header Explanation
<iostream> Contains function prototypes for the C++ standard input and output
functions, introduced in Chapter 2, and is covered in more detail in
Chapter 13, Stream Input/Output: A Deeper Look.
<iomanip> Contains function prototypes for stream manipulators that format
streams of data. This header is first used in Section 4.10 and is discussed
in more detail in Chapter 13, Stream Input/Output: A Deeper Look.
<cmath> Contains function prototypes for math library functions (Section 6.3).
<cstdlib> Contains function prototypes for conversions of numbers to text, text
to numbers, memory allocation, random numbers and various other
utility functions. Portions of the header are covered in Section 6.7;
Chapter 11, Operator Overloading; Class string; Chapter 17, Excep-
tion Handling: A Deeper Look; Chapter 22, Bits, Characters, C Strings
and structs; and Appendix F, C Legacy Code Topics.
<ctime> Contains function prototypes and types for manipulating the time and
date. This header is used in Section 6.7.
<array>,
<vector>, <list>,
<forward_list>,
<deque>, <queue>,
<stack>, <map>,
<unordered_map>,
<unordered_set>,
<set>, <bitset>
These headers contain classes that implement the C++ Standard Library
containers. Containers store data during a program’s execution. The
<vector> header is first introduced in Chapter 7, Class Templates array
and vector; Catching Exceptions. We discuss all these headers in
Chapter 15, Standard Library Containers and Iterators. <array>,
<forward_list>, <unordered_map> and <unordered_set> were all intro-
duced in C++11.
<cctype> Contains function prototypes for functions that test characters for cer-
tain properties (such as whether the character is a digit or a punctua-
tion), and function prototypes for functions that can be used to convert
lowercase letters to uppercase letters and vice versa. These topics are dis-
cussed in Chapter 22, Bits, Characters, C Strings and structs.
<cstring> Contains function prototypes for C-style string-processing functions.
This header is used in Chapter 10, Operator Overloading; Class
string.
<typeinfo> Contains classes for runtime type identification (determining data types
at execution time). This header is discussed in Section 12.9.
<exception>,
<stdexcept>
These headers contain classes that are used for exception handling (dis-
cussed in Chapter 17, Exception Handling: A Deeper Look).*/

    //as opposed to scientific notation

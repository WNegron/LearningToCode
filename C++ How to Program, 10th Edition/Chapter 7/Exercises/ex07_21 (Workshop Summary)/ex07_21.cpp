Note: 
My answer to exercise X.XX using only the tools and methods taught up to Chapter X.

This exercise is from the global Edition of C++ How to Program, 10/e 

Description:

7.21 (Workshop Summary) Use a two-dimensional array to solve the following problem. A craft
workshop has three craftspeople (1 to 3) who produce four different products (1 to 4). Once a day,
each craftsperson passes in a slip for each different type of product completed. Each slip contains
the following:
a) The craft-person’s number
b) The product number
c) The quantity of items completed
Thus, each craftsperson passes in between 0 and 4 production slips per day. Write a program that
will read in the information as supplied on each individual production slip and summarize the total
items manufactured by a craftsperson by product. All totals should be stored in the two-dimensional
array stock. After processing all the information for the last month, print the results in tabular
format with each column representing a particular product and each row representing a particular
craftsperson. Total across each row to get the total quantity manufactured by each craftsperson for
last month; total across each column to get the total quantity manufactured of each product for last
month. Display all this information in a tabular format.

Note: My answer to exercise 3.09 using only the tools and methods taught up to Chapter 3.

Description:

3.9 (Modified Account Class) Modify class Account (Fig. 3.8) to provide a member function
called withdraw that withdraws money from an Account. Ensure that the withdrawal amount
does not exceed the Accountâ€™s balance. If it does, the balance should be left unchanged
and the member function should display a message indicating "Withdrawal amount exceeded
account balance." Modify class AccountTest (Fig. 3.9) to test member function withdraw.

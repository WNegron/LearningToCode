Notes:
My answer to exercise 5.27 using only the tools and methods taught up to chapter 5.

Description:
	5.27 (Prime Numbers) An integer is said to be prime if itâ€™s divisible by only 1 and itself. For 
example, 2, 3, 5 and 7 are prime, but 4, 6, 8 and 9 are not.

    a) Write a function that determines whether a number is prime.

    b) Use this function in a program that determines and prints all the prime numbers between 1 and 
    10,000. How many of these 10,000 numbers do you really have to test before being sure that you 
    have found all the primes?

    c) Initially you might think that n/2 is the upper limit for which you must test to see whether 
    a number is prime, but you need go only as high as the square root of n. Re-write the program, 
    and run it both ways. Estimate the performance improvement.

Notes:
My answer to exercise 3.19 using only the tools and methods taught up to chapter 3.

Description:
    For Exercises 3.16â€“3.20, perform each of these steps:
        1. Read the problem statement.
        2. Formulate the algorithm using pseudocode and top-down, stepwise refinement. 
        3. Write a C program.
        4. Test, debug and execute the C program.

    3.19 (Interest Calculator) The simple interest on a loan is calculated by the formula 
    
        interest = principal * rate * days / 365;

The preceding formula assumes that rate is the annual interest rate, and therefore includes the 
division by 365 (days). Develop a program that will input principal, rate and days for several loans, 
and will calculate and display the simple interest for each loan, using the preceding formula. 

Here is a sample input/output dialog:
----------   Example Output   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Enter loan principal (-1 to end): 1000.00 
    Enter interest rate: .1
    Enter term of the loan in days: 365
    The interest charge is $100.00

    Enter loan principal (-1 to end): 1000.00 
    Enter interest rate: .08375
    Enter term of the loan in days: 224
    The interest charge is $51.40

    Enter loan principal (-1 to end): -1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------    Pseudocode    ---------------------------------------------
initialize
    interest
    principal
    rate
    days

while principal != -1
    prompt user Enter loan principal (-1 to end): 
    read & input principal

    if principal != -1
        prompt user Enter interest rate:
        read & input rate

        prompt user Enter term of the loan in days:
        read & input days

        calculate interest = principal * rate * days / 365;
        print The interest charge is: interest

-----------------------------------    End Pseudocode    -------------------------------------------
